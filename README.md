# zend-cache-psr6

[PSR-6](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/cache.md) Adapter for Zend\Cache

The PSR-6 standard is currently under REVIEW and there are no published interfaces for it. This library will try to keep 
up-to-date with PSR-6 as changes are incorporated. You're welcome to come along for the ride, but expect breakages.
